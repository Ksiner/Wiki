He is the youngest child of Maui-Covenant\'s first Home Rule Councilor Donel Aspic. The legendary Mauian Siri was his grandmother.\n\nAt age 15, the Consul watched the Hegemony siege of Maui-Covenant from his family\'s ancestral isle, beginning his sympathy for the revolutionaries and aggression against the Hegemony.\n\nThe Consul was old enough to join the Mauian rebellion at age 20, but did not at Merin\'s insistance.\n\nThe Consul finished school on Tau Ceti Center while his father was a Senator for the Hegemony.\nReturn to Maui-Covenant\nThe Consul\'s first job after school was as a government liaison to corporations engaged in the development of oil drilling infrastructure based in the Central Administration Isle on Maui-Covenant. The Consul met his wife, Gresha, in this position, and studied to join the diplomatic corps. He scored \"First\" on his diplomatic corps exams, and requested a position outside the Web.\n\nEarly Diplomatic Positions\nThe Consul was an Under Consul within five standard years and a Consul in his own right in eight. His primary role in his early consulships was to assist the colonists in advance of one day joining the Protectorate. From the Consul\'s perspective, he was really just helping the colonists destroy truly indigenous life on their planets - an apparent prerequisite to joining the Protectorate.\n\nThe planets on which the Consul held the title Under Consul included Whirl, Garden, and Hebron. Following the completion of his assignment on Hebron, the Consul suffered a career crisis, breakdown, and addiction to alcohol and the drug Flashback.\n\nThe Consul\'s career survived his post-Hebron crisis, and upon recovery he moved his family to Bressia for a position as full Consul. While Consul on Bressia, the Hegemony made plans to use Bressia as a test of Ouster military might. The Battle of Bressia ensued. Due to a slight miscalculation, the Consul remained on Bressia during the Ouster invasion. His wife, Gresha, and son Alon were killed in the subsequent fighting.\n\nHyperion Consulship\nThe Consul returned to the Web, informing CEO Gladstone that the Ousters knew that any battle at Hyperion would be a trap, but were coming anyway, and that they asked him to be a double agent - in some ways truthful and in some ways deceptive. The Consul declined Gladstone\'s offers both to raise Hyperion to Protectorate status and to promote him to Ambassador, but he did travel to Hyperion for a position as consul.\n\nThe Consul was consul on Hyperion for eleven years. During this time twelve pilgrimages were permitted to the Time Tombs; none returned. He mostly allowed his aide to govern Hyperion while he waited for the Ousters, generally while drinking at Cicero\'s.','bbd63e13-53d9-435f-9c3a-7d03edb3cd31',0),('23af4fd4-7cbc-4f94-8312-f0d2f2b67e80','kriszta-aranyi-hyperion-martin-silenus-artofkaa-fin.jpg','Martin Silenus','Youth\nMartin Silenus was the descendent of one of the wealthiest families of Old Earth. His mother used her wealth for luxury, pushed the family into debt, and spent many hours a day on stimsim. She hired a scholar to educate her son in science and art. Young Silenus spent half his life living on the edge, not limited by money. He spent the other half learning about and memorizing poetry, and started to write his own poetry.\n\nBefore the Earth was destroyed in the Big Mistake, Martin\'s mother sent him into space so that a descendent of hers would live on to pay off family debts. She perished along with Old Earth.\n\nOn Heaven\'s Gate\nAfter several years spent in cryogenic fugue, Silenus arrived on Heaven\'s Gate, a barely terraformed planet. Silenus suffered brain damage during the travel, resulting in him losing his entire vocabulary aside from several profane words. Despite this, he was found suitable for work. After several years of labor, he managed to regain his ability to speak intelligibly, and he started to write his epic poem, the Hyperion Cantos. One day a local thug attacked him while he was carrying his manuscript, and he was rescued by a manager\'s wife who read the Cantos and sent it to a publisher. The poem, edited to meet Hegemony standards, became a hit and made Silenus a millionaire. The editor hired him to write a series about Old Earth, called Dying Earth, which kept Silenus in the public eye, but his lifestyle and his efforts to publish his original Cantos sent him into debt.\n\nAfter the tenth part of the novel series Silenus realizes that he is not doing art any more, just some hackwork. He liquidates his assets and signs in to join the kingdom of Sad King Billy.\n\nOn Hyperion\nSad King Billy locates his castle near the mysterious Time Tombs to make an ideal, inspiring environment for his artists. Everything goes well except for Silenus, who finds himself unable to write even a new line for his Cantos. He paid a body-sculptor to alter himself into a satyr, and he spent ten years deflowering women in this form.\n\nAfter ten years the muse of Silenus returns, exactly the same time when mysterious murders start in the City of Poets. As the number of murdered people are growing and the murderer never found, people start abandon the city, except for Silenus, but after the last murder occurs, he can\'t continue the Cantos. Silenus spends his next year searching the mysterious murderer, the Shrike. Silenus comes to the conclusion that the Shrike is not only his muse but also his poem summoned the monster somehow.\n\nOne day Sad King Billy reappears, saying that if Silenus wants to end his Cantos, more murderer will be necessary, which can not be permitted, so he starts to burn the poems, believeing that if the manuscript is destroyed, so will be the Shrike. But the Shrike intervents, and Billy convinces Silenus to set both him and the Shrike on fire with the kerosene he bought to burn the poems. After setting the fire, the Shrike disappears with Billy.\n\nSilenus spends most of his upcoming months recopying his poem, and eventually he leaves Hyperion.','bbd63e13-53d9-435f-9c3a-7d03edb3cd31',0),('2d084e58-3d5a-4e09-9079-d2650f73885d','9ad860712f6b8635aafcb10ea260a9e3.jpg','Lenar Hoyt','Lenar Hoyt was born, raised and ordained on the Catholic world of Pacem. During his childhood, he occasionally visited the preseminary schools on Pacem, and even more rarely, the New Vatican - planetary capital and seat of the Catholic Church.\nShortly after graduating seminary, Father Hoyt was tasked with escorting Father Dure to Hyperion, a twenty-month journey with an eight year time-debt. Father Hoyt escorted Father Dure as far as the Interstellar Spaceport in Keats and returned immediately to his spinship for the return to Pacem.\nWhen Father Hoyt returned to Pacem, he was informed that during the years Hoyt was in transit all contact were lost with Duré while he was in search of the mysterious Bikura tribe on Hyperion. Father Hoyt volunteered to immediately return to Hyperion to find Father Duré.\n\nFather Hoyt arrived to Hyperion approximately ten weeks after he had last seen Father Duré; more than eight years had passed on Hyperion. He spent seven local months on Hyperion locating Dure. He made his way to Perecibo Plantation where he was able to enlist the support of the plantation administrator, Orlandi, in sending two skimmers into the cleft to locate Duré. The skimmer containing Hoyt was forced down near the cleft by a lightning storm, which also delayed rescue by the second skimmer. The Bikura killed the crew, including Orlandi\'s wife Semfa, but left Hoyt alive due to the crucifix he wore around his neck. The Bikura took Hoyt to see Duré, who they now called the Son of Flames.\n\nUnable to leave the vicinity of the Cleft on his own due to pain caused by the cruciform, Dure had attempted to force the cruciform to leave his body by nailing himself to a Tesla tree, which caused electricity to be continually run throughout his body, causing immense pain. He presumably thought this would kill him, but instead the cruciform was able to continually resurrect his body for seven years until Father Hoyt\'s return. Ultimately, Dure was proved correct - when Father Hoyt disturbed the cruciform, it fell off, allowing Dure to die the true death. The Bikura returned Hoyt to the Cleft where they gave him not only a cruciform of his own, but Dure\'s as well. Orlandi returned in the second skimmer shortly thereafter to rescue Hoyt and proceeded to destroy the Bikura village in revenge for the death of his wife.\n\n','bbd63e13-53d9-435f-9c3a-7d03edb3cd31',0),('87aa488e-0ad7-4684-88ac-2903f70a66ac','Earth.jpg','Old Earth','Introduction\nOld Earth is the term used during the time of the Hegemony to refer to our planet Earth, humanity\'s ancestral homeworld. At the time of the Final Shrike Pilgrimage, Old Earth is told to have been slowly destroyed over the course of a century by the Big Mistake, being \"eaten\" from the inside out by a black hole said to have been accidentally created by a scientific team in Kiev.\n\nThe Truth About Old Earth\nIn the Consul\'s tale, the alleged destruction was said to have been deliberately planned by the TechnoCore and its Hegemony allies for the enslavement of mankind. However, it is revealed that Old Earth is still intact as the Joseph Severn cybrid it sent there by unkown forces.\n\nLater, in the Endymion books, it is revealed that Old Earth was actually spirited away to the Lesser Magellanic Cloud 160,000 light years from Pacem, by the creatures of the Void Which Binds to protect it from the TechnoCore and to allow experimentation of mankind by the \"Lions and Tigers and Bears\" to determine whether mankind was ready to access the Void. Old Earth was returned to its original location in orbit around Sol at the exact moment of the Aenean Shared Moment.\n\n','b7c45e8a-79fa-4bd7-821c-76e3d46a4937',0),('8a987101-1749-4d35-a804-e11963d8160b','Paul.jpg','Paul Atreides','Conception\nThe Bene Gesserit brought Paul\'s parents together with the intention of producing an Atreides daughter, who could then mate with the heir to House Harkonnen to produce the fabled Kwisatz Hadarach, or super-being. However, the plans of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood were thrown into disarray when Jessica, due to her love to Leto, bore a male heir to his House.\n\nUpbringing\nAs the son of Duke Leto Atreides I, Paul grew up with a privileged background on the water-covered planet of Caladan, the ancestral home of House Atreides. Though he lacked companions his own age, he did receive tuition from his teachers, men like Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck and Doctor Yueh, as well as education in Bene Gesserit methods and techniques from his mother. Shortly after his fifteenth birthday in 10191 AG, Paul\'s father revealed to him that Paul\'s training, through his teachers, had been geared toward turning Paul into a mentat. The theory was that when Paul succeeded his father as Duke of House Atreides, one of the most respected and moral Great Houses of the Imperium, a mentat-duke would truly be a formidable force in the Landsraad. Paul\'s latent talents also earned him the attention of the Bene Gesserit, who tested him with the Gom Jabbar as they hoped to salvage their breeding program through him.\n\nThe Rise of Paul Muad\'Dib\nPaul Atreides accompanied his parents when House Atreides was relocated to the desert world Arrakis to manage mining operations of the Spice Melange. However, when the deception of House Harkonnen and the Emperor Shaddam IV was revealed, he escaped into the desert with his mother and joined the Fremen. Upon joining the desert people he took the name Muad\'Dib.\nThis experience, coupled with significant exposure to the Spice Melange triggered dormant prescient abilities within Paul\'s bloodline. These abilities, coupled with his leadership skills, his military training, and an ancient prophecy of the people of Arrakis, enabled Paul to become the leader of the formidable Fremen. It was on Arrakis that he discovered that his grandfather - the father of Jessica - was the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. He also drank the Water of Life and survived, expanding his consciousness and bringing his prescience near to perfection. He was the first and last male to drink the Water of Life and survive, showing himself to be the Kwisatz Haderach, although he claimed to be something else, something unexpected. Paul claimed, after converting the Water of Life that he could not only see the future and the past but also the present, which he called \"the now.\" His vision allowed him to see Shaddam IV\'s great fleet in space above Arrakis, ready to attack.\n\nDuring this period Paul met and fell in love with Chani, the daughter of planetologist and native Fremen Liet Kynes. Their first son, Leto Atreides II the Elder was murdered by Glossu Rabban Harkonnen, further fueling the existing enmity between House Atreides and House Harkonnen.\n\nAfter spearheading a highly effective campaign of guerilla warfare against House Harkonnen\'s spice mining and their Sardaukar forces that had taken control of Arrakis, Paul conquered the powers in Arrakeen. With his marriage with Irulan Corrino, daughter of Emperor Shaddam IV, successfully negotiated the end of the long-standing Corrino Empire and his own ascendancy to Emperor.\n\nThe New Empire\n\nUpon crowning himself Emperor in 10193 AG, Paul enacted a strategy that had been revealed to him through his prescient abilities. This decision saw the theology (and many customs) of the Fremen thrust into the whole of the Empire. A result of this was that Paul Atreides himself a revered god-head on many worlds in the Known Universe. There was resistance, and Paul found himself increasingly isolated from his family and friends as he decided that the Jihad to place his view of the future of mankind in place, must be bloodthirsty and relentless. Whole planets were sterilized as some of the Great Houses put up a struggle against Paul\'s relentless Fremen armies.','196d8b7e-b3f6-4f52-80bc-6487c7f0fded',0),('e90443f7-178f-44f1-9f8a-d723c12fa59e','Hyperion-planet.jpg','Hyperion','Hyperion is an Outback planet, notable as one of the nine labyrinthine worlds and location of the Time Tombs. It is a member of the Protectorate and can be reached by spinships with Hawking drives with 3 years\' time debt from the Web. The population was 50,000 at the time of the first Shrike murders.\n\nPhysical characteristics\nHyperion\'s sun appears smaller but brighter than Earth\'s. It has one small moon.[2] Small meteors are a common sight at night. The planet has  a weak magnetic field, making conventional EMVs useless there, but it is strong enough to keep a Hawking mat in the air. A local year was 280 days.\n\nGeography\nHyperion has three continents, named after animals: Equus, Aquila and Ursus (Latin for horse, eagle and bear).\nThe largest city is Keats (located on Equus), which has the only spaceport on the planet. Keats also houses the offices of the Hegemony consulate and later the offices of the Governor General. Keats had a population of 500,000 thousand before the Ouster threat, but after plans were made for evacuation, almost the entire population moved to Keats, so that the city housed 3 million people by the time of the attacks. Keats has a famous inn called Horatio\'s, where the former Consul spent his days drinking. The city is situated near the river Hoolie, where ships are available for transport. The old part of the city is called Jacktown.\n\nOther cities of Hyperion are Endymion on the South Continent, or the City of Poets, founded by Sad King Billy.','b7c45e8a-79fa-4bd7-821c-76e3d46a4937',0);
